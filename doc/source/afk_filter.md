# Adaptive Frequency Filter

The adaptive frequency filter (AFK) can be used to suppress incoherent noise in DAS data sets.

The filtering performance of the AFK filter, applied to an earthquake recording at an [ICDP](https://www.icdp-online.org/home/) borehole observatory in Germany. The data was recorded on a [Silixa](https://silixa.com/) iDAS v2. For more details see <https://doi.org/10.5880/GFZ.2.1.2022.006>.
