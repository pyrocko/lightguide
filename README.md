# Lightguide

*Tools for distributed acoustic sensing and modelling.*

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/lightguide.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/lightguide) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/495774991.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/495774991)

Lightguide is a package for handling, filtering and modelling distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data. The package interfaces handling and processing routines of DAS data to the [Pyrocko framework](https://pyrocko.org). Through Pyrocko's I/O engine :rocket: lightguide supports handling the following DAS data formats:

- Silixa iDAS (TDMS data)
- ASN OptoDAS
- MiniSEED

Numerical forward modelling of various dislocation sources in layered and homogeneous half-space towards DAS strain and strain-rate is employed through Pyrocko-Green's function package.

> The framework is still in Beta. Expect changes throughout all functions.

## Installation

Install the compiled Python wheels from PyPI:

```sh
pip install lightguide
```

## Usage

### Adaptive frequency filter

The adaptive frequency filter (AFK) can be used to suppress incoherent noise in DAS data sets.

```python
from lightguide import orafk_filter

filtered_data = orafk_filter.afk_filter(
    data, window_size=32, overlap=14, exponent=0.0, normalize_power=False)
```

The filtering performance of the AFK filter, applied to an earthquake recording at an [ICDP](https://www.icdp-online.org/home/) borehole observatory in Germany. The data was recorded on a [Silixa](https://silixa.com/) iDAS v2. For more details see <https://doi.org/10.5880/GFZ.2.1.2022.006>.

*The figures show the performance of the AFK filter applied to noisy DAS data. (a) Raw data. (b) The filtered wave field using the AFK filter with exponent = 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 32 x 32 sample window size and 15 samples overlap. (c) The normalized residual between raw and filtered data. (d) Normalized raw (black) waveform and waveforms filtered (colored) by different filter exponents, the shaded area marks the signal duration. (e) Power spectra of signal shown in (d; shaded duration), the green area covers the noise band used for estimating the reduction in spectral amplitude in dB. The data are neither tapered nor band-pass filtered, the images in (a-c) are not anti-aliased.*

## Packaging

To package lightguit requires Rust and the maturin build tool. maturin can be installed from PyPI or packaged as well. This is the simplest and recommended way of installing from source:

```sh
# Install rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install maturin and build
pip install maturin
maturin build
```
